# FinnishPIDVerifier

This Swift library verifies a Finnish Person ID (PID) strings (in Finnish: "henkilÃ¶tunnus").

Finnish PIDs are strings in format `ddmmyyAnnnX`, where:

* dd is the day of birth,
* mm is the month of birth,
* yy is the last two digits of the year of birth,
* A is the century character, indicating which century (1800, 1900 or 2000) the person was born,
* nnn is the individual daily number given to persons born on that day, from range 002-899 (inclusive),
  * Even numbers are for females, odd numbers for males,
  * Values >= 900 are used for test PIDs only,
* X is a control character, calculated from ddmmyynnn and using a lookup table.

## Usage

You can find an example on how to use the library in the `example` subdirectory.

```Swift
let verifier = FinnishPID.verify(pid: pid)
switch verifier.validity {
	case .validPID:
		print("PID is valid Finnish PID")
	case .invalidPID:
		print("PID is invalid Finnish PID")
	case .testPID:
		print("PID is valid test PID")
}
if verifier.isValid {
	print("PID is valid and not a test PID")
	print("PID is for a person born in \(verifier.dateString!)")
	print("Full date is \(verifier.birthDay!.formatted(date: .complete, time: .omitted))")
	print("Gender of the PID holder is \(verifier.genderString)")
	print("Date elements: day: \(verifier.day!) month: \(verifier.month!) year: \(verifier.year!)")
} else {
	print("PID is either test PID or invalid")
}
```
Using a PID `010101-123N` as an input parameter prints:

```
PID is valid Finnish PID
PID is valid and not a test PID
PID is for a person born in 1.1.1901
Full date is tiistaina 1. tammikuuta 1901
Gender of the PID holder is male
Date elements: day: 1 month: 1 year: 1901
```

The returned `verifier` struct has properties you can use to query the result from the verification:

* `isValid`, is `true` if the PID was a valid PID not in the test range.
* `validity` enumeration `Validity`, either `validPID`, `invalidPID` or `testPID`.
* `gender` enumeration `Gender`, either `.female`, `.male` or `.undefined` if not a valid PID.
* `birthDay`, a `Date` object or `nil` if PID was not valid.
* `dateString`, the birthday of the person in format "dd.mm.yyyy" or `nil` if PID is not valid nor test PID.
* `genderString`, the gender of the person as a string.
* `year`, `month` and `day` of the birthday, or `nil` if PID was not valid.
* `description`, providing a string representation of the verification, e.g. (in English locale):

```
Valid PID 210911+0785: born: 21.9.1811, gender: female
Test PID: 211123A965F: born: 21.11.2023, gender: male
```

The library is localized to English and Finnish. Date formats are fixed, but `genderString` and `description` return strings for these languages.


## Tests

The Tests folder contains tests you can use to test the implementation with generated valid Finnish PIDs as well as some test and invalid PIDS.


## Dependencies

Depends on Swift `Foundation`. Uses `swift-docc-plugin` to generate documentation.


## Using in your projects

Add the depencendy to this package in your `Package.swift` using the URL to this repository:

```Swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/anttijuu/FinnishPIDVerifier.git", branch: "main"),
```
Alternatively, use Xcode (File > Add Packages...).
